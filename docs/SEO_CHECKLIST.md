## ⚡ PHASE 1: The "Force Index" (Do This NOW)
*Goal: Tell Google you exist and are relevant immediately.*

- [ ] **1. Pick Your "Champion" Product**
    - Choose your best-selling or most unique product.
    - Go to **Admin > Products**.
    - **SEO Keywords:** Add specific tags: `Corporate Gift Dhaka, Premium Eco Notebook Bangladesh, Luxury Branding Studio`.
    - **SEO Description (The Secret Weapon):** Write a sentence that includes your location and query.
        - *Example:* "Exclusive minimalist black notepad for executive corporate gifting in Dhaka, designed by Color Hut Studio."

- [ ] **2. Submit to Google Search Console** (CRITICAL)
    - Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console).
    - Enter your URL: `https://store.colorhutbd.xyz`
    - Submit your **Sitemap**: Enter `https://store.colorhutbd.xyz/sitemap.xml`
    - **URL Inspection:** Paste the link of your "Champion Product" and click **Request Indexing**.

- [ ] **3. The "Traffic Spike" Trick**
    - Google ranks pages that get sudden traffic.
    - Share your "Champion Product" link on:
        - Facebook Page / Group
        - LinkedIn (Personal & Business)
        - WhatsApp Status
    - **Task:** Get at least 20 people to click the link and scroll down for 30 seconds. This tells Google: *"This page is interesting."*

## 🛠 PHASE 2: Weekly Maintenance (Keep Your Rank)
*Goal: Show Google your site is "Fresh" and "Active".*

- [ ] **1. Update One Product Per Week**
    - Google hates "dead" sites. Even if you just change a price or add one sentence to a description, update 1 product every week.
    - This updates the `lastmod` date in your sitemap, signaling Google to come back.

- [ ] **2. Check Your "SEO Descriptions"**
    - Slowly go through your catalog.
    - Ensure every product has a unique **SEO Description** in the Admin panel.
    - **Never** duplicate descriptions (e.g., don't use "Nice pen" for 10 different pens).

- [ ] **3. Monitor "Queries"**
    - In Google Search Console, look at "Performance" > "Queries".
    - See what people are typing to find you.
    - **Action:** If you see people searching for "Luxury Diary BD", go create a product or category with that exact name!
